Abstract
Our project for the class is based around the Malmo platform for Minecraft. We want an AI agent to perform steps within Minecraft that a normal human player would perform. That includes mining wood, creating crafting tables, creating types of pickaxes (wood, stone, iron), and finding materials to craft with (stone, iron, diamonds). The AI has to perform these tasks in specific orders (E.G mining wood, creating crafting tables, creating wood pickaxe). Also each major milestone of creating a pickaxe has subtasks of finding the materials to create the pickaxe with. 

So far what we have been able to accomplish is the beginning task needed for the rest of the tasks. Our AI is able to find and mine wooden logs, the basis of creating pickaxes and crafting tables. It also is able to avoid lava spots so as to not continually die over and over from falling into it. The AI also avoids hitting dirt blocks over time and only hitting the wooden logs due to the reward system laid out for the AI.
